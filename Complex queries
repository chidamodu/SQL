1. Use JOIN to display the capital, the country, and the flag name.
SELECT flags.name, countries.continent, countries.capital
FROM flags
JOIN countries
ON flags.country=countries.country


2. Use JOIN and WHERE to display the continents associated to the flags in the flags table when the flag
has a name (i.e. not ‘NA’).
SELECT flags.name, countries.continent, countries.capital
FROM flags
LEFT JOIN countries
ON flags.country=countries.country
WHERE flags.name != NULL


3. Use JOIN and HAVING to display continents that have at least 2 countries represented as well as the
average adoption date of the flag (as avg_date).
SELECT countries.country, countries.continent, COUNT(countries.continent) AS repeated_continents, AVG(flags.adoption_date) AS average_date
FROM countries  
JOIN flags
ON flags.country=countries.country
GROUP BY countries.country, countries.continent
HAVING repeated_continents   >= 2
