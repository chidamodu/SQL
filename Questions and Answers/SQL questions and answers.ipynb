    "\n",
    "You can only have one primary key, but you can have multiple columns in your primary key.\n",

    "You can also have Unique Indexes on your table, which will work a bit like a primary key in that they will enforce \n",

    "------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "Composite Primary Key\n",
    "\n",
    "A Table can have a Composite Primary Key which is a primary key made from two or more columns. For example:\n",

    "  userid INT,\n",
    "  userdataid INT,\n",
    "  info char(200),\n",

    ");\n",
    "\n",
    "------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "You ask if you can have more than one primary key field and you most certainly can. You can have only one primary key, \n",
    "but that can consist of as many columns as you need to uniquely identify your rows.\n",

    "\n",
    "CONSTRAINT pk_PersonID PRIMARY KEY (P_Id,LastName) \n",

    "\n",
    "If you think you want more than one primary key, then the answer is \"not really.\" You can have only one primary key. \n",
    "However, you can have as many indexes as you want that have a unique constraint on them. A unique index does \n",
    "pretty much the same thing as a primary key.\n",
