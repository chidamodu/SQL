Aggregates include commands such as DISTINCT, COUNT, SUM, GROUP BY, HAVING, and ORDER BY. Try using these commands on the following questions!

1. Use DISTINCT to list the continents in the countries table - each continent should appear only once.
SELECT DISTINCT continent
FROM countries

2. Use COUNT to see how many countries are in Europe.
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT country)
FROM countries
WHERE continent IN (‘Europe’)

3. Use GROUP BY to count how many countries are in each continent, with continents alphabetically ordered.
SELECT country, continent, COUNT(country) AS country_in_each_continent
FROM countries
GROUP BY continent, country
ORDER BY continent, country

4. Use HAVING to determine which continents are represented at least twice in the countries table.
SELECT country, continent, COUNT(continent) AS repeated_continents   
FROM countries  
GROUP BY country, continent 
HAVING repeated_continents   >= 2
ORDER BY country, continent
